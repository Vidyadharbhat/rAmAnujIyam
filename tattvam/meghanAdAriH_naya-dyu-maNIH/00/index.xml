      <description>&lt;p&gt;ix&#xA;The achievements of the Indians in the realm of philosophy are very great and of outstanding merit. The results arrived thereby are varied in nature and diverse in outlook. They are classified under different heads, the principle underlying such a classification being the characteristic feature which is common to those results brought under one head. Each has come to be called a system of thought but the term which has been in vogue to refer to each head is darśana. This term conveys the sense of intuition which a seer possessed and was therefore responsible for the development of a system based on that particular intuition which may concern with truth (tattva) or knowledge of soul (ātmajñāna). The term system, however, denotes the sense of systematisation. Every system of Indian thought, as it is called darśana, has its source traced to the divine vision or the intuition of a sage with whose name it is associated. The Nyaya system is called Gautamadarśana, as Gautama&amp;rsquo;s name is associated with its beginnings. The names Pātañjaladarśana, Jaiminiyadarśana and others admit of similar explanations.&#xA;Among the various systems of thought, some are called nästika as they deny validity to the Vedas and others are called ästika as they are based on the authority of the Vedas. Among the systems in the astika group, it is only the Vedanta darśana that has regular develop- ment and continuity to the present day. It has a powerful influence over the people of this land and has become popular among some sections of scholars in the West. This system has been solely de- voted to the investigation into and study of the nature of God designa- ted as Brahman, selves called atman and the material world and the interrelation between these. Hence it has been very popular and a living principle of life in this land. On the contrary, the systems other than the Vedanta dealt with matters mostly different from these. If in certain cases, these matters also were dealt with, it was only done in an indirect way, very often to seek support for the conclusions arrived at in those systems. Any way, the matters dealt with in the Vedanta system were given secondary importance in these. It is but natural that these remained to arouse only academic interest with the exception of the Mimāmsã and Yoga systems which, in spite of having had practical value, could not produce on the people of the land that amount of influence which the Vedanta has been by supplying the soul in bondage with information regarding the nature of soul and a solution for the ills of the world.&#xA;The name Vedanta is given to this system as this is based on the Upanisads which form the concluding portions of the Veda&amp;rsquo;s. The Upanisads, unlike the remaining portions of the Vedas, deal with the natures of Brahman, soul and world and the question of their interrelation. The teachings of the Upanisads were to be acquired by pupils from the preceptors with utmost secrecy. The Upanisads&#xA;B&#xA;X&#xA;could therefore be held to contain secret instructions. Interpretation of the passages of the Upanisads depends on the long successive line of teachers and pupils who have been maintaining the traditional line of interpretation. The line of teachers and pupils had not been one but many and therefore the interpretations of the passages offered by various teachers differed from each other. In fact, even in the interpretation of one and the same passage, this difference became pronounced in the various lines of teachers and pupils. The Upanisads themselves contain many doctrines diverse in character and sometimes conveying mutually contradictory ideas. Thus there are passages which speak of the monistic, dualistic and pluralistic doc- trines. Some support yogic discipline while others uphold the worship of the deities. Some passages speak of the world as unreal while others as real. Brahman is identical with the selves according to some and different according to others. Interpretations offered by the various teachers for many of these passages are opposed to each other.&#xA;Attempts were made by some scholars of old to give a systematic exposition to the teachings of the Upaniṣads but did not produce any appreciable result. Their results are mentioned by sage Badarāyaṇa who composed the Brahma Sutras on the teaching of the Upanisads. These s tras are aphorisms, very brief and unintelligible except with the aid of commentaries. The traditional interpretations of these sutras offered by the scholars began to vary from each other. The attempt of the scholars was to interpret, in accordance with the tradition handed down to them, these sutras in the light of the teaching of the Upanisads. Many of these scholars took the Bhagavadgītā for supporting their interpretations. Thus the Upanisads, Brahma- sutras and Bhagavadgītā became the triple basis of the Vedanta (Prasthānatraya). Due to this difference in the interpretations offered by the teachers, many schools arose in the Vedantadarśana. All the schools base their tenets on all these basic texts and profess their implicit authority to the Upanisads. It must, however, be remembered that the object of treatment, whether it is Brahman, self, or the world, would not get changed merely because the passages in the Upanisads dealing with them were interpreted differently by the various scholars however eminent they might have been. If, however, it had been possible to change the object of investigation by the method of interpretation adopted, scholars would not have been in a position to understand the object as they were taught the line of interpretation by their preceptors. Or, the object must have been changing every time a scholar adopted a novel method of interpreta- tion while studying that object. Posterity would have become bewil- dered unable to identify that object when it was undertaken for scru- tiny. Such a thing did not happen. That is why, it has been possible for the precursors and leading exponents of the various schools ofxi&#xA;Vedanta to undertake an independent line of investigation and study of the Brahmasutras and the Upaniṣads. The passages of the Vedas, Bhagavadgītā, Purāņas and Itihāsas, Nyaya, Mimämsä, and San- khya are utilised to their advantage while interpreting the Brahma-&#xA;sutras.&#xA;Before the rise of the important schools of Vedanta now in vogue, attempts were made, by some scholars among whom Bhartṛprapañca was prominent, to interpret the Brahma sūtrās. Bhartṛprapañca held that Brahman was identical with and at the same time different from the world of sentient and insentient beings. Brahman is one involving variety due to the infinite number of selves and innumerable distinctions in the universe. At the time of creation, what was one, namely Brahman, became transformed into the manifold universe. This view is called Bhedabhedavāda and Brahmapariņāmavāda. The means for liberation is right knowledge and religious duty both combined and having equal importance (jñānakarmasamuccaya). This view was refuted by Sankara but was revived unsuccessfully by Bhaskara and Yadavaprakāśa in slightly different forms. After Rāmānuja, they lost their significance and were forgotten.&#xA;For understanding the principles on which the schools of Vedān- ta are based, it is enough if some groups of passages in the Upanisads are taken up and studied as to how each group had been responsible for the rise of a particular school of Vedanta. In the main, there are three such groups. One group teaches non-difference between Brah- man and the world consisting of sentient and insentient beings. The second speaks of the difference between them. The third teaches the relation between them. According to the first group of passages, Brahman is faultless and stainless. It is motionless and peaceful. It is without attributes. It is knowledge and bliss. There is nothing apart from it. If one realises that everything is the soul, what else can he see? Everything in the world is nothing but Brahman.1 According to the second group of passages, one becomes immortal by knowing his own self and the ruler as distinct from each other. The Universal Lord thought to create the beings. He is the Lord of the universe. He is the Lord of Himself. He is the highet Lord of the Lords. He is the supreme deity of the deities. He has everything under His control. 2&lt;/p&gt;</description>
